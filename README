## GitHub for the Expedia Hackathon 2018 (Pink Team)
This is the repository we used to complete our programming challenge(s)

The challenge was: Design a system that improves the travel experience for a group of people
We decided to focus on people who were blind, as they have significant issues with deciding on where to go,
and actually booking everything.

The aim of the system is to make the proces significantly easier, by offering a portal where users could
find out about what a location is like for a blind person, from verified individuals, both blind and not.
The intention is that they can then easily book the entire trip at the same time, on the web platform.
However, due to time limitations, this did not happen in the end.
